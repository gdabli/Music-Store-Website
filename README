Hi Professor,

I am working on project alone. I have created user App part only.

Thanks
Gaurav

Note: to run this project on UNIX/Linux with HSQLDB (easiest way):
1. Start the HSQLDB server as explained in JdbcCheckup.java or use
   "ant start-hsqldb" after cd'ing to the database directory here.
   
2. Use "ant config-hsqldb" , then "ant sysTest" when cd'd to this directory

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables as discussed in build.xml
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
  For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW
  See ~eoneil/.cshrc for Solaris UNIX commands to define these (but use your own user, pw!)
  See ~eoneil/tomcat.bash for the corresponding Linux commands
